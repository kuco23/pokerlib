[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pokerlib.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pokerlib)

## General
A Python poker library which focuses on simplifying a poker game implementation,
when its io is supplied. It includes modules that help with hand parsing and poker game continuation.

One application of this library was made by the PokerMessenger app, 
which supplies library with io in the form of messenger group threads.
The app's repo is at https://github.com/kuco23/pokermessenger.

## Tests
Basic tests for this library are included. 
For instance `round_test.py` can be started from os terminal, by typing `python round_test.py <player_num> <game_type>`,  after which a simulation is run with not-that-informative  data getting printed in stdout.
